	    <div> <br> Current position : Postdoctoral fellow at Centrale Nantes <br><br> Research interests: 
		    My research mainly focuses on the development of optimization algorithms to solving problems that arises in automatic control and road design.
		    <ol>
			  <li>Automatic control: Several problems in automatic control can be fromulated as low-dimensional Semi-Infinite Program (SIP). In this field, my research concerns the formulation of such SIP and their resolution with Branch and Bound algorithm based on interval analysis to ensure the global optimality of the solution. </li>
			  <li>Road design: The problems arising in road design involves lots of variables and can be formulated as Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP). My main interest in this field is to develop tools to proove quickly the feasibility of such programs, and heuristics to find rapidly good feasible points. </li>
		    </ol><br> Keywords: Automatic control, Semi-Infinite Programming, Road design, Large scale MILP.
